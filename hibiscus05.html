                <p>
                    Alyogyne huegelii is a flowering plant found in the Southwest botanical province of Western
                    Australia, extending along its entire coastline. A large-flowered shrub, the species favours the
                    sands of coastal shrublands and heath. The large flower, highly variable in colour, is similar to
                    that of Hibiscus. It was previously placed in that genus, and is commonly named lilac hibiscus and
                    blue hibiscus. It is widely cultivated as a flowering plant for the garden. Previously published
                    varieties and cultivars are no longer formally recognised.

                <h2 class="mono">Description</h2>
                <p>
                    hrub to 4 metres with many alternate branches, although lower ones may be sparse. Bright green
                    leaves are divided in three to five in outline; margins are irregular, lobate to toothed; pubescent
                    and strongly veined lobes are coarse in shape. The flower stalk at the leaf axil is long, tilting at
                    the single flower.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mono">Cultivation</h2>
                <p>
                    A large number of variants in the species have been cultivated, the colours of white, cream, purple.
                    lilac, mauve, and the somewhat erroneous blue are traded as varieties or cultivars. The natural
                    variance of leaf form has also been exploited in the selection of plants for the market, fine or
                    dissected leaves may have been hybridised with Alyogyne hakeifolia. The former name of Hibiscus
                    huegelii, along with other synonyms, is still given in some sources. Propagation is successful by
                    cuttings, grown in well-drained soil, avoidance of frosts and the usual caution regarding phosphorus
                    and species from the region is recommended. The sparse lower branching habit of the species, and
                    inducement to a desirable habit, is achieved by heavy pruning after flowering. The species was grown
                    in English greenhouses during the nineteenth century and is now grown in temperate climates of the
                    United States of America and Europe.
