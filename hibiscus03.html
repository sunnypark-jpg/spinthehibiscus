                <p>
                    Hibiscus syriacus is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to
                    areas of east Asia, but widely introduced elsewhere, including much of Europe and North America. It
                    was given the epithet syriacus because it had been collected from gardens in Syria. Common names
                    include the rose of Sharon (especially in North America), Syrian ketmia, shrub althea (or simply
                    althea), Korean rose and rose mallow (in the United Kingdom). It is the national flower of South
                    Korea and is mentioned in the South Korean national anthem.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mono">Desciption</h2>
                <p>
                    Hibiscus syriacus is a hardy deciduous shrub. It is upright and vase-shaped, reaching 2–4 m (7–13
                    feet) in height, bearing large trumpet-shaped flowers with prominent yellow-tipped white stamens.
                    The flowers are often pink in color, but can also be dark pink (almost purple), light pink or white.
                    Individual flowers are short-lived, lasting only a day. However, numerous buds produced on the
                    shrub's new growth provide prolific flowering over a long summer blooming period. The soil in which
                    the Hibiscus thrives is moist but well-drained, and organically rich. Hibiscus syriacus is highly
                    tolerant of air pollution, heat, humidity, poor soil and drought. The species has naturalized very
                    well in many suburban areas and might even be termed slightly invasive, so frequently does it seed.
                </p>

                <h2>Cultivation</h2>
                <p>
                    Though it has no fall color and can be stiff and ungainly if badly pruned, H. syriacus remains a
                    popular ornamental shrub today, with many cultivars. Full-grown plants can tolerate a wide range of
                    conditions, including frost, drought and urban pollution. However, the best results are produced in
                    a warm, sheltered position; a well-drained neutral soil; and full sun.[15]

                <h3>Propagation</h3>
                <p>
                    Hibiscus syriacus is fairly easily propagated from either seeds, with variable results, or by
                    layering or cuttings, cloning the original.
